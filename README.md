LDFW - Basic 2D HTML5 + Canvas Framework for Ludum Dare
=======================================================

This framework is (structurally) pretty close to LibGDX, so you may want
to take a look at their documentation. In `coffescripts/game` you will find
an example I made (a ball jumping around).

Installation
------------

* Clone the project: `git clone git://github.com/saschagehlich/ld27`
* Switch to `framework` branch: `git checkout framework`
* Install the npm modules: `npm install`
* Install the grunt command line interface: `npm install grunt grunt-cli -g`
* Run the watcher using `grunt`

Behind the scenes
-----------------

* Sprite sets are generated using TexturePacker (http://www.codeandweb.com/texturepacker)
